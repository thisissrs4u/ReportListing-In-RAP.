First Thing we have to create Data Base table. If we have tables lets use those.
Here we have used DB Tables: /dmo/connection, /dmo/flight, /dmo/carrier, /dmo/airport. 
On top of these we have created CDS views.</br>
CDS View entity: ZSRS_I_Connections_I, ZSRS_I_Flight_I, ZSRS_I_Carrier_I, ZSRS_I_Airport_I
